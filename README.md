ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my github!

I am a full-stack software engineer and recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have cultivated a passion for agile, test-driven, and comment-first development with a DevOps methodology. I have a particular interest in Artificial Intelligence and its potential intersections with climate justice and sustainability. I strive to design, implement, test, and monitor code that is high-quality, scalable, and secure. Currently, I am working with the startup American Technology Initiative as their lead Enterprise Resource Application developer.

Check out my projects, please!!
